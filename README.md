# iOS-MyBudget
MyBudget is a high performance budgeting iOS application designed to help people save for their future.


Functionality I want in it.

Salary break down that gives users information on where their pre-tax money is going e.g tax, student loans, health care.

Then that gives them their main income spot where they can use that information for informed decisions on their budgeting.

Ability to add secondary income that has the same effect as above. 

Pre-made budget categorys but also the ability to create custom categorys.

Ability to do forcasting on where their savings will be in 1month...1year etc.

Forcasting with compound interest.

Graphs and breakdowns on expenses in certain areas, maybe tips on where to look to reduce spending to increase savings.

Eventually... 

Ability to link Accounts where Couples can share one account to track and manage expenses on.
